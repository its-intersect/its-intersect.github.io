                        I like listening to music which sounds full. What full means is a journey itself. It's a question I've taken time to think about and after reflecting on different elements of music I gravitate to, I know what a full sound means to me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's start of with one person singing a song on their own, no backing track, no instrumentalist, no background singers, just that one voice. This is the starting point for me. A raw sound which is not full. Nothing wrong with this sound, it has it's place but when you are listening to it, you may feel like harmonising, or snapping your fingers so as to add some rhythm or thinking of a bassline. Your brain can realise possibilities of where to add things as something is missing. So how do we start making a sound more full?

                    <h2>Option 1: Intensity/numbers</h2>
                    <p>
                        Adding more voices can always do wonders. This is voices in unison. I like unison (when people are in tune!). I remember watching the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony and there was a Welsh kids choir which sang "Guide me great Jehovah" in unison. Maybe I should do another blog post on unisonðŸ¤”? The different timbres of different peoples voices but all singing the same notes is powerful enough to enrich sound.

                    <h2>Option 2: Instruments</h2>
                    <p>
                        Instruments can add rhythm, harmony, texture and different tones to a song. It can be a singer accompanied by a guitar or a choir singing with an orchestra. There are so many options to intensify a song by adding the right instrumentation.

                        This can be 2 voices singing together, a 4-part choir, 6-part ensemble or an orchestra. Harmony creates colour, and brings out the meaning of words (when a song is sung).

                        Music is an art, therefore contrast matters. Sound should not be full all the way through an album or song, or reliant on one method of filling it up. Listen to the good music out there, they fill up sound, sometimes it thin, or they swap the methods of filling up the sound at different points. Next time you have a song, think about how you can create the contrast as well as making the sound full!
