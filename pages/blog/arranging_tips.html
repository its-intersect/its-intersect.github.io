                    <p>
                       I got introduced to arranging during lockdown when everyone was at home and I had too much time on my hands. I had done some arrangements before then but they were done from my own knowledge of vocal parts and without any music theory knowledge or research into the subject. Over time, Iâ€™ve picked up a few things regarding vocal arranging (from choirs, TTBB, SATB, 6-part harmony), horn solis as well as big band charts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you love harmony, you are probably aware of 6/7 part harmony singing and thatâ€™s usually the most people do. (Not to say thereâ€™s no room for any more parts). Before one starts arranging for 6, one should learn to master for 4 parts first and then add parts bit by bit.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <h2>So 4 part arrangingâ€¦ Where to begin?</h2>
                    <p><em>(this guide assumes a basic knowledge of music as well as a passion for arranging)</em></p>
                    <p>
                        A definition first of what we want to achieve. By 4-parts I mean, 4 distinct parts i.e. if it was a chord letâ€™s say a <code>C Major</code> (there would be 4 different notes). Most of the time when people sing/make 4-part arrangements, they mean 4 voices. An example of this is hymns or most gospel a cappella music. The bottom part (usually bass), is probably doubling the melody or the second part (usually an alto/tenor). This means in most of the 4 part songs you may hear, thereâ€™s room to add a lot of harmony and colour before adding any more voices/people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    A bit of music theory to elaborate on this. If you have been making 4 voice arrangements (with 3 parts), the building blocks would probably have been major and minor triads (i.e. happy and sad chords with 3 distinct notes). We now have to form different basic building blocks, 7th chords. Hereâ€™s a small table to show what notes to add to form the 3 basic chords (<code>major 7</code>, <code>minor 7</code> and <code>dominant 7</code>).
                    </p>

                            <tbody>
                                <tr>

                                </tr>
                                <tr>

                                    <td>C-Eb-G-Bb</td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>C dominant 7</td>
                                    <td>C-E-G-Bb</td>
                                </tr>
                            </tbody>

                    <p>
                        There are other chords youâ€™ll come across (e.g. suspended chords, augmented, diminished..) but weâ€™ll work with our basic building blocks today.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So how do you apply this knowledge so as to form arrangements? Itâ€™s not about changing every chord into 7th chords but itâ€™s about understanding note groups. So if we take a 7th chord, each note belongs to a group (see chart below)

                        So letâ€™s put this knowledge into steps one can follow to make an arrangement then:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make the arrangement as you would normally (3 parts, with 3 voices/4 voices)</li>
                        <li>Go through each instance of time and highlight where notes are repeated if any.</li>
                        <li>Label each instance of chord (if itâ€™s a minor or major chord)</li>
                        <li>For each instance, if itâ€™s a minor chord, you want to transform it to a min 7, if itâ€™s major, you want to change it to maj7 or dom7. (how do you know which one, from experience, youâ€™ll know which sound you want, but to start, a piano is a good tool to use and compare)</li>
                        <li>After you know which chord you want, you can either substitute the repeated note with the missing note from the chord or just add the missing note. (google is your friend if you need to know which notes make up a chord)</li>
                        <li>After adding the notes for each chord (meaning you were working vertically), you now have to traverse each part and ensure there is voice leading and no jumping. If thereâ€™s jumping, you can rearrange the voices so that each voice sings a different note of the chord but doesnâ€™t mean the chord is changed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                    All these steps will get you a decent 4 part song but to take it a step further and make it more jazzy, you have to introduce group substitutions. (advanced tips now)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Remember the note groups mentioned earlier and how each note in a chord belongs to either root, 3rd, 5th or 7th group? instead of playing those exact notes of the chord, there are always suitable substitutions in that group. (see table below, examples given for chords on C)

                            So how do you use this chart? Letâ€™s say you hit an instance where the chord was a Cmaj and then you decided to make the chord into a <code>C dom 7</code>, and you then selected the notes <code class="c-blue">C-E-G-Bb</code>, you may then have bad voice leading or you want a different sound. You can go into the chart under â€˜Dominant substitutionsâ€™ and then select a group you want to change and pick one of the notes. That means Cdom7 in 4 part voicing could end up having the notes <code class="c-blue">C-E-F-Bb</code> or <code class="c-blue">D-E-Ab-Bb</code>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With time and practice, you wont need the steps to do this or the chart but your head will figure this out as you write a score. This opens up the door to harmonic extensions and after knowing how to write well for 4 parts, thereâ€™s more to explore with regards to voicing those 4 parts and then 5 parts, 6 parts and moreâ€¦

                        This was a lot of theory but there is a video showing a small section of a hymn being reharmonised from 3part-4voices to 4part-4voices. It features other techniques but all useful for arranging purposes.
